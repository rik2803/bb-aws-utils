# `bb-aws-utils` - Bash functions to build and deploy docker images from a BitBucket pipeline

## IMPORTANT

To solve [this](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-Pipelines-articles/Pushing-back-to-your-repository/ba-p/958407),
users of this library will always have the origin set to `SSH` **unless** the
environment variable `BB_USE_HTTP_ORIGIN` is set.

Otherwise, the HTTP orogin will be used, which offers improved authentication
functionality, but will not work for repositories with branch protection.

## What these functions can be used for

* Build Java project, build a docker container and push the container to a AWS ECR repo
* Build an (NPM) project, create a tarball and push it to a S3 bucket
* Package a Lambda function, ZIP it and push it to a S3 bucket

## Pipeline requirements

The environment can be defined in 2 places:

* The BB pipeline settings (this is the preferred way for secrets)
* With a `export` statement in the `bitbucket-pipel;ines.yml` file. This
  should **not be used** for secrets

### Environment for docker image build and push

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ECR_SOURCE`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ECR_SOURCE`
* `AWS_REGION_SOURCE`: Optional, default is `eu-central-1`
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ECR_TARGET`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ECR_TARGET`: **Must be secret**
* `AWS_REGION_TARGET`: Optional, default is `eu-central-1`
* `DOCKER_IMAGE`

### Environment for triggering pipeline for another project

The `deploy` step triggers the pipeline of a repository that contains the configuration
for that specific environment. This trigger is done using the BB pipeline REST API.

IMPORTANT: The script `sync_trigger_bb_build.bash` requires `jq`

* `BB_USER`
* `BB_APP_PASSWORD`: See [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/app-passwords-828781300.html) to create a BB application password
* `REMOTE_REPO_OWNER`
* `REMOTE_REPO_SLUG`

## The `docker_build` function

Use this function to build a docker artefact image from a source code repository.

The scipt looks for the file `Dockerfile` in these locations:

* `/${BITBUCKET_CLONE_DIR}/Dockerfile`
* `/${BITBUCKET_CLONE_DIR}/docker/Dockerfile`

The complete list of environment variables:

* `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_TARGET`: Also tries `AWS_ECR_ACCOUNTID` if
  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_S3_TARGET` is not set.
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* `DOCKER_IMAGE`

The image will be available as:

* `${AWS_ACCOUNTID_TARGET}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION_TARGET:-eu-central-1}.amazonaws.com/${DOCKER_IMAGE}:latest`
* `${AWS_ACCOUNTID_TARGET}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION_TARGET:-eu-central-1}.amazonaws.com/${DOCKER_IMAGE}:${BITBUCKET_COMMIT}`
* `${AWS_ACCOUNTID_TARGET}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION_TARGET:-eu-central-1}.amazonaws.com/${DOCKER_IMAGE}:${BITBUCKET_TAG}` if it is a tag triggered build and `${RC_PREFIX}`
  is defined and `[[ ${BITBUCKET_TAG} = ${RC_PREFIX}* ]]`


## The `s3_artifact` function

The function `s3_artifact` runs an optional command `BUILD_COMMAND` on the
repository, creates a tarball containing the results and copies the tarball
to a S3 Bucket using AWS credentials defined by `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_S3_TARGET`
and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_S3_TARGET`.

The complete list of environment variables:

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_S3_TARGET`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_S3_TARGET`
* `BUILD_COMMAND`: Optional command to build the artifact
* `ARTIFACT_NAME`
* `PAYLOAD_LOCATION`
* `S3_ARTIFACT_BUCKET`

The artifact will be available as:

* `s3://${S3_ARTIFACT_BUCKET}/${ARTIFACT_NAME}-last.tgz`
* `s3://${S3_ARTIFACT_BUCKET}/${ARTIFACT_NAME}-${BITBUCKET_COMMIT}.tgz`

## The `s3_deploy` function

Artifacts that were created using `s3_artifact` can be deployed using `s3_deploy`.

The function:

* Downloads an artifact tar file from `S3_ARTIFACT_BUCKET`
* Unpacks the tar file in a `workdir` directory
* (optional) Replaces `__VARNAME__` placeholders with the value of
  `CFG_${VARNAME}` in all files in `workdir`
* Recursively copies the content of `workdir` to `S3_DEST_BUCKET`
* (optional) Invalidates the CloudFront distribution if
  `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` is defined

An overview of all allowed environment variables:

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_S3_SOURCE`: AWS read-only credentials for the bucket
  that contains the artifact file
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_S3_SOURCE`: AWS read-only credentials for the bucket
  that contains the artifact file
* `S3_ARTIFACT_BUCKET`: Name of the bucket that contains the artifact file
* `ARTIFACT_NAME`: Basename of the artifact. Will get `-last.tgz` suffix (default)
  or `-${TAG}.tgz` suffix (if file `TAG` exists `${TAG}`'s content is used to
  set the value of `${TAG}`)
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_S3_TARGET`: AWS read-write credentials for the bucket that will
  receive the files
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_S3_TARGET`: AWS read-write credentials for the bucket
  that will receive the files
* `S3_DEST_BUCKET`: Name of the destination bucket
* `S3_PREFIX` (**optional**): Prefix to be used for the copy, the default is
  no prefix (empty string)
* `AWS_ACCESS_CONTROL` (**optional**): ACL permissions to set on the destination files.
  Default is `private`, allowed values can be consulted [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl).
* `CFG_*` (**optional**): All variables starting with `CFG_` can be used to configure
  the files in the budld artifact. How this works:
  * Imagine the variable `CFG_BACKEND_URL` with value `https://mybackend.acme.com`
  * All files under `workdir` (where the tarball is unpacked) will be scanned for
    the string `__BACKEND_URL__`.
  * Every occurence of `__BACKEND_URL__` will be replaced with the string
    `https://mybackend.acme.com`
* `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` (**optional**): When this variable is defined, the
  _CloudFront_ distribution with that name will be invalidated.

## The `bb_bump_service_version_in_awscdk_project` function

### Requirements:

**Service Repository**

* Evironment variable `AWS_CDK_PROJECT` must be set
* Environment variable `SERVICE_NAME` must be set, this has to be like `myNewProjectService
* The Jira issue must be in your branch name, like `feature/PROJ-1234-my-new-project`

**AWS CDK Project Repository**

* Add the following to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "resolveJsonModule": true
  },
  ...
}
```

* Import the `serviceVersions.json` file in your `config/default.ts` file:

```typescript
import {serviceVersions} from "./serviceVersions.json"
````

* Add the `serviceVersions` to the config of your `envConfig`:

```typescript
const envConfig: VbsEnvConfig = {
  serviceVersions,
  ...
}
```

### This function:

* Creates the variable `jira_issue` with the value `PROJ-1234`, this is based on the branch name
* Gets the new version of the service using `maven` and saves it to `project_version`
* Clones the `AWS_CDK_PROJECT` repository from BitBucket
* Checks if the same branch exists in the `AWS_CDK_PROJECT` repository, if not it will create it and checkout the branch
* Changes the version of the service in `config/serviceVersions.json` to the new version
* Commit and push the changes to the `AWS_CDK_PROJECT` repository

## Build a docker deploy image and deploy to AWS ECS Cluster Service

The scripts are:

* `bb-aws-utils/build-and-push-docker-image.bash`
* `bb-aws-utils/deploy-docker-image.bash`

What this does:

* use the credentials `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ECR_SOURCE` and
  `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ECR_SOURCE` to login to the source ECR
* build a new docker image _FROM_ the image
  `${AWS_ACCOUNTID_SRC}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION_SOURCE:-eu-central-1}.amazonaws.com/{DOCKER_IMAGE}:${TAG:-latest}`
  where `${TAG}` is the content of the file `TAG`
* use the credentials `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ECR_TARGET` and
  `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ECR_TARGET` to login to the target ECR
* Tag the new image and push it to `${AWS_ACCOUNTID_TARGET}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION_TARGET:-eu-central-1}.amazonaws.com/${DOCKER_IMAGE}-${ENVIRONMENT:-dev}`
* Disable the alarms that contain the string in the variable `${CW_ALARM_SUBSTR}`
  (skip this step if the variable is not set)
* Run following command to forcibly update (this will pull the latest image from the
  task's definition) of the service:

```
aws ecs update-service --cluster ${ECS_CLUSTER} --force-new-deployment --service ${ECS_SERVICE} --region ${AWS_REGION:-eu-central-1}
```

  * And finally wait 120 seconds for the update to finish and enable the _CloudWatch_ alarms (skip this step if the variable  `CW_ALARM_SUBSTR` is not set)

### Example BB pipeline file

```yaml
image: python:3.6

pipelines:
  custom:
    build_and_deploy:
      - step:
          name: Build and push Docker deploy image and start deploy
          script:

```

### Environment
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ECR_SOURCE` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ECR_SOURCE`: Credentials for the
  source ECR where the docker image is based upon.
* `AWS_ACCOUNTID_SRC`: AccountID where the source ECR is hosted
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ECR_TARGET` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ECR_TARGET`: Credentials for the
  destinatino ECR in the account of the environment where the service is running
* `AWS_ACCOUNTID_TARGET`: AccountID where the destination ECR is hosted
* `AWS_REGION`: The region (optional, default is `eu-central-1`)
* `ECS_CLUSTER`: The name of the cluster where the service to update is running
* `ECS_SERVICE`: The name of the service to update
* `ENVIRONMENT`: The environment (`dev`, `prd`, ...)
* `DOCKER_IMAGE`: The name of the docker image, without the tag
* `CW_ALARM_SUBSTR`: Determines the _CloudWatch_ alarms that will be paused during
  deployment of the service

## Package a Lambda function

### How

This explains how to build the Lambda function package and publish it to an S3 bucket.
Whenever the function is required in an AWS account, it can be downloaded from that bucket.

It's important that the accounts that need to use the Lambda function have read
access to the S3 bucket to be able to installthe Lambda function.

The BB pipeline build requires these pipeline environment variables:

* `LAMBDA_RUNTIME`: One of:
  * `python2.7`
  * `python3.6`
  * `nodejs8.10`
* `LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`: The name to use to store the function in the S3 bucket
* `LAMBDA_PUBLIC`: Also copy the file to `${S3_DEST_BUCKET}-public` with `public-read` permissions
* `S3_DEST_BUCKET`: The name of the bucket the function should be deployed to
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Credentials with write access to `S3_DEST_BUCKET`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Credentials with write access to `S3_DEST_BUCKET`

The result of a succeeded pipeline run is:

* A S3 object named `${LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME}.zip` on the bucket `S3_DEST_BUCKET`
* A S3 object named `${LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME}-${BITBUCKET_COMMIT}.zip` on the bucket `S3_DEST_BUCKET`

It is adviced to use the S3 object that has the commit string in its name, to have a form of version management.


#### `python` specific actions

* If libraries need to be installed, create a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your
  project. The dependencies will be installed by the pipeline.
* The Lambda function file should be called `lambda.py` or referenced by the
  environment variable `LAMBDA_FUNCTION_FILE`

#### `nodejs` specific actions

* If libraries need to be installed, create a `package.json` file in the root of your
  project. The dependencies will be installed with `npm i` by the pipeline if this
  file exists.
* The Lambda function file should be called `index.js` or referenced by the
  environment variable `LAMBDA_FUNCTION_FILE`

### A `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` example
